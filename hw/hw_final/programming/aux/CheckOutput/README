  In order to work towards the performance deadline, we have released a 
  mechanism which reports some error metrics given some input [a.txt, x.txt]
  and an output [b.txt]. 

  You may copy this code and modify it locally if you desire, but it is not necessary.
  You can compile it with nvcc sparseMV.cu

  You can run the code with

    $ ./a.out a.txt x.txt b.txt

  You can test this within this directory using

    $ ./a.out small_a.txt small_x.txt small_b.txt

  And you will see that there is a rounding error, as small_b.txt are single precision values
  But the internal script is using double precision.
