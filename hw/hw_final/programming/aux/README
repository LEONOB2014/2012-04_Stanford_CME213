We have released a modified script.

You can find the matrices directly stored in /usr/tmp/cme213

To avoid having everyone store many large datasets on the cluster, we have released the datasets in an alternative form.

In benchmarksuite, you can find a python script which will generate sample input.

You can generate sample output with 
Usage: python readMM.py file.mtx q N

For example:
python readMM.py matrices/cant.mtx 100000 20
